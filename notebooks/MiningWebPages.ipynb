            "Anna Lauren Hoffman will present an online training course, Data Ethics: Designing for Fairness in the Age of Algorithms , October 4-5, 2016. Register now for hands-on practice seeing the warning signs early in your design process.\n",
            "When I explain the value of ethics to students and professionals alike, I refer it as an “orientation.” As any good designer, scientist, or researcher knows, how you orient yourself toward a problem can have a big impact on the sort of solution you develop—and how you get there. As Ralph Waldo Emerson once wrote , “perception is not whimsical, but fatal.” Your particular perspective, knowledge of, and approach to a problem shapes your solution, opening up certain paths forward and forestalling others.\n",
            "Data-driven approaches to business help optimize measurable outcomes—but the early planning of a project needs to account for the ethical (and in many cases, the literal) landscape to avoid ethically treacherous territory. Several recent cases in the news illustrate this point and show the type of preparation that enables a way to move forward in both a data-driven and ethical fashion: Princeton Review’s ZIP-code-based pricing scheme, which turned out to unfairly target Asian-American families , and Amazon’s same-day-delivery areas , which neglect majority-Black neighborhoods.\n",
            "You can approach a new project using a road trip analogy. The destination is straightforward—profit, revenue, or another measurable KPI. But the path you take to get there will need to be determined. If my wife and I, for example, want to drive from our apartment in Oakland (Point A) to visit my wife’s sister in Los Angeles (Point B), we have to figure out how we’d like to approach the trip. If we’re concerned primarily with efficiency, certain questions immediately come to the fore, namely: what’s the fastest route to LA? Determining the fastest route requires us to pay attention to certain features of the possible trip, such as traffic speeds, easily accessible gas stations, and traffic conditions.\n",
            "On the other hand, if my wife and I are interested in taking the most scenic route from Oakland to LA, a whole different set of concerns become salient. Gas stations are likely still relevant, but speed is less of a factor. We’ll also want to take into account things like notable landmarks and towns (and my tendency toward car sickness) along the way.\n",
            "The destination is the same; the laws we have to abide by are the same, but how we get from Point A to Point B, then, is heavily determined by how we orient ourselves toward the trip in the first place.\n",
            "The same goes for research or design projects: how you orient yourself or your team toward solving certain problems or achieving certain goals will fundamentally shape the journey you take. If you’re interested in reaching a goal as quickly as possible—if your only concern is speed or turnaround time—a particular set of concerns are going to be salient. But if you’re interested in reaching a goal not only efficiently but ethically, then a different set of concerns will pop up.\n",
            "Moreover, understanding ethics as a way of orienting yourself toward a problem helps differentiate ethical behavior from mere legal compliance; just as the laws governing driving constrain my possible actions but don’t fully determine the contours of my road trip, nor do the laws or regulations governing data collection, storage, and use exhaust the possible decisions you and your team may face.\n",
            "My students lovingly refer to this as \"Anna's red flags” approach—teaching folks to see and address red flags they’d otherwise miss along the way. Of course, orienting yourself toward your work with an eye to ethics is only a starting point. Simply intending to do ethical data science isn’t enough; once you’ve established an orientation, you need information and specialized training.\n",
            "In the case of The Princeton Review, it’s clear that the program designers had a suspicion that they could charge higher prices to customers in wealthier areas. Similarly, the city maps showing Amazon’s same-day delivery areas are immediately recognizable to residents of those cities as showing where people of color live. An awareness of the distribution of wealth and race in the U.S. would have set off alarm bells in either case—but this requires asking at the beginning of a research query “Are we about to build a proxy for race and class with this model?” \n",
            "To return to the road trip analogy, since both my wife and I are Midwestern transplants, we don’t have a deep background and knowledge of California to help guide our journey. Instead, we have to ask for help from folks with more extensive expertise in the space between the Bay Area and Southern California.\n",
            "Similarly, you may have some ideas about data ethics already. You and your team may have even discussed the topic, but you likely don’t have deep knowledge in applied ethics of data or technology, it’s not enough to rely only on your own (necessarily limited) perspective to guide you. Instead, you need to be proactive in reaching out to consult experts in the field, taking advantage of training opportunities when available, and diversifying the range of voices informing your work.\n",

            "<p>Even with the rise of open source tools for large-scale ingestion, messaging, queuing, and stream processing, siloed data and data sets trapped behind the bars of various business units is the normal state of affairs in any large enterprise. Data unification or integration refers to the set of activities that bring this data together into one unified data context. Schema matching and mapping, record linkage and deduplication, and various mastering activities are the types of tasks a data integration solution performs. Advances in ML offer a scalable and efficient way to replace legacy top-down, rule-based systems, which often result in massive costs and very low success in today’s big data settings. Bottom-up solutions with human-guided ML pipelines (such as Tamr, Paxata, or Informatica—<em>full disclosure: Ihab Ilyas is co-founder of Tamr</em>) show how to leverage the available rules and human expertise to train scalable integration models that work on thousands of sources and large volumes of data. We discussed some of the challenges and enablers in using ML for this class of problems in an earlier <a href=\"https://www.oreilly.com/ideas/three-enablers-for-machine-learning-in-data-unification-trust-legacy-and-scale\">post</a>.</p>\n",
            "\n",
            "<p>The class of data unification problems has its own characteristics in terms of solution complexity: (1) the problem is often quadratic in the size of the input (since we need to compare everything to everything else), and (2) the main ML task is fairly understood and is mainly determining if two “things” are the same. These characteristics have a considerable impact on the design of the solution. For example, a complex sophisticated model for finding duplicates or matching schema is the least of our worries if we cannot even enumerate all possible pairs that need to be checked. Effective solutions for data unification problems tend to be a serious engineering effort to: (1) prune the space of possible candidates; (2) interact effectively with experts to provide training data and validate the machine decision; and (3) keep rich lineage and provenance to track decisions back for auditing, revising, or reusing for future use cases. Due to the nature of the ML task (mainly Boolean classification here), and the richness of structure, most successful models tend to be the good old “shallow” models, such as random forest, with the help of simple language models (to help with strings data).

            "<p>Siloed or integrated data is often noisy, missing, and sometimes even has contradicting facts. <em>Data cleaning</em> is the class of data quality efforts that focuses on spotting and (hopefully) repairing such errors. Like data integration, data cleaning exercises often have been carried out with intensive labor work, or ad-hoc rule-based point solutions. However, this class has different complexities and characteristics that affect the design of the solution: the core ML task is often far more complex than a matching task, and requires building models that understand “how data was generated” and “how errors were introduced” to be able to reverse that process to spot and repair errors.</p>\n",
            "\n",
            "<p>While data cleaning has long been a research topic in academia, it often has been looked at as a theoretical logic problem. This probably explains why none of the solutions have been adopted in industry. The good news is that researchers from academia recently managed to leverage that large body of work and combine it with the power of scalable statistical inference for data cleaning. The open source <a href=\"http://www.holoclean.io\">HoloClean</a> probabilistic cleaning framework is currently the <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.03402\">state-of-the-art system</a> for ML-based automatic error detection and repair. HoloClean adopts the well-known <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noisy_channel_model\">“noisy channel”</a> model to explain how data was generated and how it was “polluted.” It then leverages all known domain knowledge (such as available rules), statistical information in the data, and available trusted sources to build complex data generation and error models. The models are then used to spot errors and suggest the “most probable” values to replace.</p> \n",
            "\n",
            "<p>Paying attention to scale is a requirement cleaning and integration have in common: building such complex models involves “featurizing” the whole data set via a series of operations—for example, to compute violations of rules, count co-occurrences, or build language models. Hence, an ML cleaning solution would need to be innovative on how to avoid the complexity of these operations. HoloClean, for example uses techniques to prune the domain of database cell and apply judicious relaxations to the underlying model to achieve the required scalability. Older research tools struggled with how to handle the various types of errors, and how to combine the heterogeneous quality input (e.g., business and quality rules, policies, statistical signals in the data, etc.). The HoloClean framework advances the state of the art in two fundamental ways: (1) combining the logical rules and the statistical distribution of the data into one coherent probabilistic model; and (2) scaling the learning and inference process via a series of system and model optimizations, which allowed it to be deployed in census organizations and large commercial enterprises.</p>\n",

            "<ol>\n",
            "\t<li>ML models for cleaning and unification often need training data and examples of possible errors or matching records.

            "\n",
            "<p>An important paradigm for solving both these problems is the concept of <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/1605.07723\">data programming</a>. In a nutshell, data programming techniques provide ways to “manufacture” data that we can feed to various learning and predictions tasks (even for ML data quality solutions). In practical terms, “data programming” unifies a class of techniques used for the programmatic creation of training data sets. In this category of tools, frameworks like <a href=\"https://hazyresearch.github.io/snorkel/\">Snorkel</a> show how to allow developers and data scientists to focus on writing labeling functions to programmatically label data, and then model the noise in the labels to effectively train high-quality models. While using data programming to train high-quality analytics models might be clear, we find it interesting how it is used internally in ML models for the data unification and cleaning we mentioned earlier in this post. For example, tools like <a href=\"http://www.tamr.com\">Tamr</a> leverage legacy rules written by customers to generate a large amount of (programmatically) labeled data to power its matching ML pipeline. In a <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.02285\">recent paper,</a> the HoloClean project showed how to use “data augmentation” to generate many examples of possible errors (from a small seed) to power its automatic error detection model.</p>\n",

The \"flash crash\" of 2010 was an economic event created purely by the software that runs our financial systems going awry. However, the real danger of the Skynet moment isn’t what happens when the software fails, but when it is working properly: when it’s maximizing short-term shareholder value, without considering any other aspects of the world we live in.

As Andrew Ng has said, we're being asked to <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/brandlab/2015/05/andrew-ng-deep-learning-mandate-humans-not-just-machines/\">worry about overpopulation on Mars</a>. We have more immediate problems to solve. What we do have are organizations that are already maximizing their own paper clips, and that aren’t intelligent by any standard. That’s a concrete problem we need to deal with now. Talking about future paper clips might be interesting or thrilling, but in reality, it’s a way of avoiding dealing with our present paper clips. As Stross points out, Elon Musk is one of the recent popularizers of paper clip anxiety; yet, he has already built his own maximizers for batteries and space flights. It’s much easier to wax philosophical about a hypothetical problem than to deal with a planet that is gradually overheating. It’s a lot more fun, and a lot less threatening, to think about the dangers of a hypothetical future AI than to think about the economic, political, sociological, and environmental problems that face us now—even if those two sets of problems are really the same.</p>\n",

I’m not terribly concerned about the things that could go wrong with an artificial general intelligence, at least in part because we won’t get the chance to worry about AGI if we don’t deal with the problems we have in the present. And if we do deal with the problems facing us now, Tim O’Reilly’s Skynet moment and Stross’s present-day paper clip maximizers, we will inevitably develop the tools we need to think about and manage the future’s paper clip maximizers. Getting our present systems back under control and contributing to human welfare is the only way to learn how to keep our future systems, whatever they might be, working for our collective good.</p>\n",

In models of infectious diseases, the tipping point represents the threshold of infectivity and susceptibility beyond which a disease becomes an epidemic. Similarly, in product development systems there exists a threshold for problem-solving activity that, when crossed, causes firefighting to spread rapidly from a few isolated projects to the entire development system. Our analysis also shows that the location of the tipping point, and therefore the susceptibility of the system to the firefighting phenomenon, is determined by resource utilization in steady state.</i>\n",

And if you doubt the value or longevity of this technology, consider that Gartner predicts that by 2019, virtual personal assistants “will have changed the way users interact with devices and become universally accepted as part of everyday life.”\n",

Contouring the learning rate over time is similar to contouring the speed of a car according to road conditions. On smooth, broad roads such as a highway, we can increase our speed (learning rate), but on narrow, hilly, or valley roads, we must slow down. Keep in mind that “...a high learning rate... [indicates] the system contains too much kinetic energy and the parameter vector bounces around chaotically, unable to settle down into the deeper, but narrower parts of the loss function” (see Karpathy’s Notes for cs231n). Such decay makes the learned network resistant to random fluctuations that could possibly reverse the learning. Learning rate decay\n",

            "Non-adaptive learning rates can be suboptimal. Learning rate decay can be brought about through reducing decay by some constant factor every few epochs, or by exponential decay, in which the decay takes a mathematical form of the exponential every few epochs. “Decay” is often considered a negative concept, and in the current case of learning rate decay it’s a negative, too: it refers to how much the learning rate is decreasing. In a car, for instance, we decrease the speed to suit the road and traffic conditions; this deacceleration can be understood as a “decay” in the velocity of the car. Think of a local minima as a speeding ticket, a toll or traffic light, or traffic congestion—something that basically increases the time taken to reach the destination. The RMSProp adaptive learning rate by Tieleman and Hinton, 2012, keeps a moving average of the squared gradient for each weight to normalize the current gradient.

Cross entropy’s niceties include a log term, making it more granular, while taking into account the closeness of the predicted value with the target.

Two different loss functions, the cross entropy and the classification error, are compared. When the learning rates are high, almost exponential jumps are seen (Learning rate 1 and .5). Each layer has a different fan-in or the number of inputs, that determines the overshoot effect caused by simultaneously updating the incoming weights of a unit aimed at correcting the same error (as is the case in the global learning rate). Hence, the appropriate learning rates can vary widely between weights. A fix for this issue involves setting a global learning rate and multiplying it by an appropriate local gain that is determined empirically for each weight. While using separate adaptive learning rates, either the entire batch should be used for learning, or larger mini-batches should be used in order to ensure the changes in the signs of the gradients are not mainly due to the sampling error of a mini-batch or random fluctuations. These per-weight adaptive learning rates can also be combined with momentum.

When you build the second one, it's hard to be sure it's exactly the same. The only way to be sure you've covered everything is to fail over in earnest. But there can still be some forgotten components of the system that only run in one or two places. Parts of the system that are only used in disasters need the most testing, or they'll fail you when you need them. But someone needs to keep a big picture of what depends on what, because it can get very tangled very fast. You can even end up with things that indirectly depend on themselves—for example, a device that you need to configure to bring up the network, but you can't get to it while the network is down.

            "Five questions for Cynthia Savard Saucier on how design impacts Shopify’s business outcomes, and tips for improving designer-developer communication.I recently asked Cynthia Savard Saucier, Director of UX at Shopify and author of Tragic Design, to discuss the design process, its impact on Shopify’s business outcomes, and how to improve communication between designers and developers. Cynthia is presenting a keynote on The impact of design: How design influences outcomes at the O’Reilly Velocity Conference, taking place Oct. 1-4 in New York. 1. Describe your design process and an example of the impact it’s had on business outcomes at Shopify. The floor plan is pretty much a representation of our roadmap. Also, every project has a multidisciplinary trio of leads (product, engineering, and UX). They make decisions together, and ensure a good team alignment. Second, we often start the design process with a design sprint, inspired by Google Ventures. A lot of effort goes into tweaking our processes so they work for the project, people, and product. This seems quite obvious, but I know from experience that surprisingly few UX professionals ever get to meet their users. To use a biology reference: designers and developers are not in a neutral relationship (where both entities simply live together), but rather a mutualist association (where they benefit from each other). We might think that error management is not as important as other pieces of the interface. 4. If you’re a designer, invite developers to your design feedback sessions and vice versa.

However, before 2011 and the advent of deep learning, big data, and cloud computing, these solutions were far from sufficient for mass adoptions and commercial use. Together with more data, available cloud computing, and adoption from big companies like Apple (SIRI), Amazon (Alexa), and Google, there were significant improvements in the performance and the products released to the market. Recent advances of neural models in speech\n",

            "The past six years of speech recognition has created more breakthroughs then the previous 40+ years. In order to understand the impact of deep learning and the part it plays, we need to understand first how speech recognition works. Although speech recognition has been in active research for almost 50 years, building machines that understand human speech is one of the most challenging problems in AI. This level is very similar to every machine learning task; in other words, given some data, we need to do proper data pre-processing and feature extraction. The impact is so far-reaching that even today, almost every solution in the field of speech recognition probably has one or more neural-based algorithms embedded within it. Usually the evaluation of speech recognition systems is based on an industry standard called Switchboard (SWBD). The evaluation of a speech recognition system is based on a metric called word error rate (WER). WER refers to how many words are misrecognized by the speech recognition system. Source: Yishay Carmiel. This development was a game changer for speech recognition, an almost 77% relative improvement. Now there are a wide range of applications, such as Apple SIRI, Amazon Alexa, Microsoft Cortana, and Google Now. Unfortunately, there isn’t a single method. Deep learning and speech recognition are so entangled that creating a state-of-the-art system involves a variety of different techniques and methods. Figure 4. Source: Yishay Carmiel. Creating a state-of-the-art system is not an easy task, and building it involves implementing and integrating all these different techniques into the system. Dealing with distant speech is a challenging problem that is being actively researched by a lot of groups. Generating synthesized data and training systems based on that is getting good attention today. Scalability\n",
            "\n",
            "Since deep learning is so entangled with speech recognition, it consumes a non-trivial amount of CPU and memory. As a result, there is research toward edge speech recognition that preserves the quality of a cloud-based system. The first problem is the issue of sensitivity to noise. A speech recognition system works pretty well from a close microphone and non-noisy environment; however, distant speech and noisy data degrades the system rapidly. Scaling the systems poses a tremendous challenge. In addition, we lack data on many languages, and a speech recognition system is difficult to create with low data resources. Or is a new solution waiting to be discovered? After all, the recent advances in speech recognition are just one piece of the puzzle: language understanding itself is a complex mystery—maybe an even greater one.\n",

            "New technology is allowing researchers to use digitization to help detect cancer. She ended up building the world’s largest online, preclinical pathology database, which catalyzes and could ultimately lead to the automated detection of cancer. The most common stain, H&E, is a mixture of an acidic dye (hematoxylin) and a basic one (eosin), which will stain cytoplasm pink and nuclei purple. But there are hundreds of “special stains” to detect tissue elements (e.g., muscle fibers, glycoproteins, and mucins), microorganisms (e.g., fungi and bacilli), or specific ions like ferric iron (Fe3+). While standard H&E staining is automated, using special stains or IHC can take significant time to optimize. When Ke founded HistoWiz four years ago, there were already instruments available that would automate histopathology (though they were uncommon to see in everyday research labs). Ke was inspired by the open source genomic research model, in which searchable databases exist that everyone can access and contribute to. An H&E stained slide of metastatic murine lung cancer, available in HistoWiz’ demo slide gallery. Ke’s mission is to “fight cancer cooperatively.” No more slide boxes or static representative images—this database allows researchers to do tissue-driven data mining by using whole slides in a massive dataset. And last but not least, the moonshot. This approach would be cheaper and faster than current methods (genetic sequencing, for example). Different users will have different levels to help distinguish tags from the in-house pathologists, versus the slide owner, versus the general public.

In this podcast episode, I speak with Eliot Knudsen, data science lead at Tamr, a company that uses AI to integrate data across silos. Data integration is often a painstaking, highly manual process of matching fields and resolving entities, but new tools can work alongside human experts to discover patterns in data and make recommendations for automatically merging it. Knudsen points to Andrew Ng’s assessment that “if a typical person can do a mental task with less than two seconds of thought, we can probably automate it using AI either now or in the near future.” AI-driven products that make more complex judgments need to acknowledge their limitations and invite humans into the loop.\n",

            "Gathering, preparing, and enriching the right data—particularly training data—is essential and remains a key bottleneck among companies wanting to use machine learning. In RL, the goal is to learn how to map observations and measurements to a set of actions, while trying to maximize some long-term reward. Ray allows users to run simulations in parallel and comes with a Python API that makes it accessible for data scientists (Ray itself is written mainly in C++). Its creators have made it simple for others to use Python to write and run their own algorithms on top of Ray, including regular machine learning models. Why do you need a machine learning library and what algorithms are important for continuous learning? Recall that in RL one needs to learn how to map observations and measurements to a set of actions, while trying to maximize some long-term reward. Recent RL success stories mainly use gradient-based deep learning for this, but researchers have found that other optimization strategies such as evolution can be helpful. Unlike supervised learning where you start with training data and a target objective, in RL one only has sparse feedback, so techniques like neuroevolution become competitive with classic gradient descent. There are also other related algorithms that might become part of the standard collection of models used for continuous learning (e.g., counterfactual regret minimization used recently for poker). Most companies are still in the process of learning how to use and deploy standard (offline) machine learning, so perhaps discussing continuous learning is premature. As with any other new method or technology, the starting point is to identify uses cases where continuous learning potentially provides an advantage over existing offline approaches. The set of companies already using bandit algorithms (to recommend content or evaluate products) can probably quickly identify use cases and become early adopters. Companies are realizing that in many settings machine learning models start degrading soon after they get deployed to production.\n",

Joseph and Robert will be presenting a session on Event Sourcing at Global Scale at Netflix at O’Reilly Velocity Conference, taking place October 1-4 in New York. The primary challenge when operating a service in a distributed architecture at scale is managing for the behavior of your downstream dependencies. Whether those dependencies are a datastore or a restful API defining timeouts, fallback data, and concurrency of the interactions will be the defining factor of your service. Your service may scale wonderfully, but if a dependency is not accounted for then the overall service can quickly fall over.Continue reading Building—and scaling—a reliable distributed architecture.\n",

In this article, and the accompanying notebook available on GitHub, I am going to introduce and walk through both the traditional reinforcement learning paradigm in machine learning as well as a new and emerging paradigm for extending reinforcement learning to allow for complex goals that vary over time. I will start by demonstrating how to build a simple Q-learning agent that is guided by a single reward signal to navigate an environment and make deliveries. To allow for greater flexibility, I will then describe how to build a class of reinforcement learning agents, which can optimize for various goals called “direct future prediction” (DFP). This value estimation should correspond to the discounted expected reward over time from taking action \\((a)\\) while in state \\((s)\\). Delivery drone scenario for goal-based RL\n",

This “delivery drone” scenario will be our guiding paradigm in the discussion of goal-based RL going forward. If we want our drone to learn to deliver packages, we simply provide a positive reward of +1 for successfully flying to a marked location and making a delivery. Rendering of simple drone delivery environment. This can be considered something close to the optimal number of deliveries possible within 100 steps, given the size of the environment.

One of the things that they teach new physicians is the phrase “When you hear hoofs, think horse, not zebra.” The principle is quite simple—the odds are the patient has the more common diagnosis than a rare, improbable one.

First Human Embryos Edited in USA (MIT TR) -- Mitalipov is believed to have broken new ground both in the number of embryos experimented upon and by demonstrating that it is possible to safely and efficiently correct defective genes that cause inherited diseases. Although none of the embryos were allowed to develop for more than a few days—and there was never any intention of implanting them into a womb—the experiments are a milestone on what may prove to be an inevitable journey toward the birth of the first genetically modified humans.

            "Authors Julia Silge and David Robinson discuss the power of tidy data principles, sentiment lexicons, and what they're up to at Stack Overflow.“Many of us who work in analytical fields are not trained in even simple interpretation of natural language,” write Julia Silge, Ph.D., and David Robinson, Ph.D., in their newly released book Text Mining with R: A tidy approach. I recently caught up with Silge and Robinson to discuss how they’re using text mining on job postings at Stack Overflow, some of the challenges and best practices they’ve experienced when mining text, and how their tidytext package for R aims to make text analysis both easy and informative. Why did you create the tidytext text mining package in R? We created the tidytext package because we believe in the power of tidy data principles, and we wanted to apply this consistent, opinionated approach for handling data to text mining tasks. Tidy tools like dplyr and ggplot2 are widely used, and integrating natural language processing into these tools allows R users to work with greater fluency. A word like “share” has a positive meaning in most contexts, but is neutral in financial contexts, where it usually refers to shares of stock. Applying the Loughran-McDonald lexicon allows us to explore the sentiment content of documents dealing with finance with more confidence. One example we deal with is text in job postings; we use text mining and modeling to match job listings with people who may be interested in them. Data scientists and analysts like us are usually trained on numerical data in a rectangular shape like a table (i.e., data frame), so it takes some practice to fluently wrangle raw text data. When your data is tidy, you can use a common set of tools for exploring and visualizing them. Using consistent tools designed for handling tidy data gives us a dependable framework for understanding how to represent text data in R, visualize the characteristics of text, model topics, and move smoothly to more complex machine learning applications. What is the difference between text mining and natural language processing? We describe our work as “text mining” because our goal is extracting and visualizing insights, but there is a great deal of overlap.\n",
